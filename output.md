Based on the provided project data and details, the following potential problems and solutions can be identified:

### **Identified Issues**

1. **Manual Task Management**: The status of tasks is updated manually by the project manager each week, which can lead to delays in real-time updates and potential inaccuracies.

2. **Manual Status Reporting**: Weekly status reports sent to the CTO could be streamlined, leading to increased efficiency and reduction in the workload of the project manager.

3. **Delayed Task Completion**: A significant number of employees (20 out of 100) are behind schedule on their tasks, which impacts the entire project timeline.

4. **Task Interdependencies**: The delay of any particular task can create a bottleneck effect, causing delays in downstream tasks owned by other employees.

5. **Resource Allocation**: The project appears to be under-resourced given the current progress versus planned outcomes and deadlines.

6. **Risk Management**: Several high-risk tasks (e.g., tasks assigned with 'High' risk) have not shown any progress, which is critical for cloud migration performance and security.

### **Proposed Solutions**

#### 1. Implement a Robust Task Management System
- **Action**: Utilize a project management tool (e.g., Jira, Asana, Trello, or similar) for real-time updates.
- **Benefit**: This reduces manual errors, provides better visibility on task statuses, facilitates the identification of bottlenecks, and allows teams to collaborate effectively.

#### 2. Automate Status Reporting
- **Action**: Integrate automated reporting features within the project management tool.
- **Benefit**: This would save the project manager time and allow for timely updates to stakeholders without manual input.

#### 3. Address Employee Performance: Close Monitoring and Support
- **Action**: Set up regular performance reviews for employees struggling to complete tasks on time. Offer necessary support, like mentoring or additional resources.
- **Benefit**: This ensures that issues are identified early, and employees receive the support they need to complete their tasks.

#### 4. Conduct a Root Cause Analysis on Delays
- **Action**: Hold discussions or brainstorming sessions with involved employees to assess why tasks are delayed (e.g., scope changes, skill gaps, unclear instructions).
- **Benefit**: Understanding the exact causes will lead to better solutions tailored to specific issues, which may include retraining or reallocating tasks.

#### 5. Improve Resource Allocation
- **Action**: Analyze where resources are most needed and redistribute personnel across tasks based on urgency and strategic importance.
- **Benefit**: Redistributed resources can help to mitigate further delays, especially for high-risk tasks.

#### 6. Plan for Risk Management
- **Action**: Create a risk management plan that includes risk assessments for tasks with high levels of uncertainty or complexity. Regularly reassess risks throughout the project.
- **Benefit**: This will minimize the impact of unexpected issues on project progress and allow for contingency plans to be activated when necessary.

### **Budget and Timeline Reassessments**
- **Action**: Conduct a cost-benefit analysis of additional funds needed to bring the project back on track (the projected $1 million increase).
  - Re-evaluate the current tasks budget, considering reallocations and optimizing expenditures.
  - Check if the additional 6 months extends the existing budget sufficiently to reallocate the workload without incurring extras.
  
### **Next Steps**
1. Schedule a meeting with all stakeholders to present these findings and proposed solutions.
2. Determine key personnel responsible for the implementation of the respective solutions.
3. Set a timeline for how soon these changes can be operational.
4. Focus on developing a communication plan to keep teams informed as changes occur.

Implementing these solutions should position the project for on-time completion while also maintaining a focus on quality and efficiency in the remaining phases of the cloud migration platform development.
